# t<sup>2</sup> = F
 
# â–  Relationship between t-statistic and F-statistic in a simple linear model

In a simple linear model with only one explanatory variable, the t-statistic and F-statistic are related as follows:

## t<sup>2</sup> = F

This specific relationship between the t-statistic and F-statistic holds because
with only one explanatory variable, testing that variable is effectively the same as testing the entire model.

Below is the derivation that shows how these two statistics come to have this relationship.
